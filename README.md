##Swiss Tournament Application

This application is an assignment for the course Intro to Relational Databases, part of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree Program. It is an application that helps manage Swiss style tournaments. The objective was to write a program using Python in conjuction with PSQL that would pass all tests found in the file tournament_test.py.

         git clone http://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm fullstack, this will create a new directory named fullstack, a clone of Udacity's repository for this assignment which holds all of the configuration files needed to run this application.

    Move to the vagrant folder by entering: cd fullstack/vagrant/

    Clone Project: From Git, clone this project by entering the 
         following command:

After executing the last command above, enter the following command:
python tournament_test.py
This command will test against the file provided by Udacity to ensure all criteria is met.
